  																																										Its a data analytic tool designed mainly to improve the efficiency of the interactive voice response system. Analysing customer behaviour is another feauture of this system that leads to immediate and tangible benefits in terms of direct cost savings, customer experience, improve network capacity and raising net promoter score (NPS). Custom IVRS designed by Serco Global Services captures the detailed traversal of all calls that were received by the contact center. The nodes in the IVRS have been classified as either productive (self service nodes) or non productive (routed to agent interaction). Feauture and reports included are Duration spend on the Self service Node, Same call multiple self service nodes, Transfers,Last node call count of transfers, Last node wise duration of transfers, Standard Error/Max tries, Minute Peak utilization of IVR, Nodes where no input was given by customers.
